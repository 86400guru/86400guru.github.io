## Open Source Heroes Get Things Done

Open source development communities depend upon a competent HERO with a vision ... the competent HERO with vision builds something which the HERO needs, but will be generally improved through demanding use by people who might have ways of doing it better ... by leading the development community in this manner, the HERO proves HERO status ... there's no substitute for the actual history of having done this ... it is PARTLY about programming and being knowledgable about code, but it is MOSTLY about initiating the development community which will eventually generate a group of competent extenders of the tool and supply a new HERO to take over maintenance of the tool that is too important for everyone to do without.

### Leading development is about learning to exponentially increase the value of one's time

Open source development is much tougher than proprietary development ... NOBODY is getting paid; NOBODY has to care; NOBODY even has to show up ***virtually*** ... open source BEGINS with understanding what is of value to others, understanding motivation ... but that begins with the HERO understanding what would be valuable to the HERO, what would motivate the HERO ... because the HERO is NECESSARILY going to doing it all alone for a good long while. Not very many working for a wage are going to understand this level of LEADERSHIP ... but it's still all about VALUE and MOTIVATION.
