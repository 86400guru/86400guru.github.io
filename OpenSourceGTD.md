## Open Source GTD

Open source development communities depend upon a competent HERO with a vision ... the competent HERO with vision builds something which the HERO needs, but will be generally improved through demanding use by people who might have ways of doing it better ... by leading the development community in this manner, the HERO proves HERO status ... there's no substitute for the actual history of having done this ... it is PARTLY about programming and being knowledgable about code, but it is MOSTLY about initiating the development community which will eventually generate a group of competent extenders of the tool and supply a new HERO to take over maintenance of the tool that is too important for everyone to do without.

### Leading development is about exponentially increasing the value of one's time
