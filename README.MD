This particular listing hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) ... this means that the [entire repository](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/) is meant to be forked and then edited, revised and optimized for your purposes ... which suppost first and most important principle time optimization, ie you must KNOW YOUR OWN UNIQUE WHY.

Every last thing in this repository is geared toward that all-important set of tasks which are all about really understanding YOUR OWN life's mission and then devise YOUR OWN strategy for optimizing your OWN time in order to accomplish YOUR OWN life's mission accordingly ... there's nothing here that is about giving the appearance of having your life organized according to someone else's plan.

### Github Pages and the discipline of FREE open source

This [README.md page](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/blob/main/README.md) is a top-level list of annotated lists of awesome lifehacks and time management materials that are available. The best way to improve these tools is to really ***use*** them for significant periods of time, eg a month or longer -- of your course, you may encounter failures in your own implementation or notice ways that the tool could be improved. Sharing your efforts to improve and work to make your own time management system robust or possibly even antifragile against those failures will not only make you stronger but it will help others. The second principle of 86400.GURU time management discipline is to embrace open source development and, through your own efforts, work at making open source development work much better by using it even for the smallest elements of your life, such as your time management discipline.
