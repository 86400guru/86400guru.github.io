## 86400.GURU

86400.GURU is primarily about simple disciplines that we all can use in order to build stronger habits to optimize each one of the 86400 seconds in each day.

It uses [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because the [entire repository](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/) is meant to be forked and then changed, edited, revised and optimized for your own purposes. 

### The first and most important principle of time optimization is that you must KNOW YOUR OWN UNIQUE WHY.

Every last thing in this repository is geared toward that all-important set of tasks which are all about really understanding YOUR OWN life's mission and then devise YOUR OWN strategy for optimizing your OWN time in order to accomplish YOUR OWN life's mission accordingly ... there's nothing here that is about giving the appearance of having your life organized according to someone else's plan. The entire reason for the existence of this repository is for YOU to think deeply about time management in YOUR life for YOUR purposes. It's YOUR time ... it's up to YOU to optimize YOUR time.  


### The discipline of making others more productive

This [README.md page](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/blob/main/README.md) is a top-level list of annotated lists of awesome lifehacks and time management materials that are available. The best way for anyone to master and improve these tools is to really ***use*** them ... in order to share your lessons with others.

Using these tools means that they must be internalized and made habitual; it's not enough to read over the list and think, "That's looks good; I'll do that" -- it is necessary to actually USE the tool with the intention of mastering it, for significant periods of time, eg a month or longer. 

Of course, you will encounter failures or things that don't quite work in your own implementation.  If you are thinking critically, you will notice subtle ways that even a great tool could be improved. Sharing your frustrations and development attempts or other efforts to improve execution will not just make your own time management system robust or possibly even antifragile against those failures ... it  will also make your you stronger, more empathetic, more of a 10Xer as you try to help others. 

This is why the second principle of 86400.GURU time management discipline is to embrace open source development and, through your own efforts, work at making open source development work much better by using it even for the smallest elements of your life, such as your time management discipline.
