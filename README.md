## 86400.GURU

86400.GURU is primarily about simple disciplines that we all can use in order to build stronger habits to optimize each one of the 86400 seconds in each day.

It uses [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because the [entire repository](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/) is meant to be forked and then changed, edited, revised and optimized for your own purposes. 

This [README.md page](https://github.com/86400guru/86400guru.github.io/blob/main/README.md) is a top-level list of annotated lists of awesome lifehacks and time management materials that are available. The best way for anyone to master and improve these tools is to really ***use*** them ... in order to share your lessons with others. *Nobody learns more in any form of classroom than the one teaching the lesson.*

### Make others more productive

Really ***using*** these tools means that they must be internalized and or made habitual and second-nature; it's not enough to read over the list and think, "Meh, that's looks good; I'll do that" -- it is necessary to actually plan how to change your habits to USE the tool with the intention of mastering it, in production and under stress, for significant periods of time, eg a month or longer. 

Of course, you will encounter failures or sources of pain with things that just don't quite work in your own implementation ... it HAS TO BE painful to some degree, or else, you have not really changed anything. It's like learning Git after you've used another version control system -- if it's not painful, then you either never really used something else or you have not really yet learned to use Git. Becoming more productivi is about getting tougher and people do not just natually get tougher. Get used to the fact that *making others more productive is not going to be recieved well AT FIRST.*   

If you are thinking critically but optimistically as you go along, you will notice subtle ways that even a great tool could be improved. Sharing your frustrations and development attempts or other efforts to improve execution will not just make your own time management system robust or possibly even antifragile against those failures ... it  will also make your you stronger, more empathetic, more of a 10Xer as you try to help others. 

### KNOW YOUR WHY

The first and most important principle of time optimization is that you must KNOW YOUR OWN UNIQUE WHY ... and you must also understand why you never really know your own unique why well-enough ... there's always another facet, maybe another level of depth, another thing to learn from somebody else *even after you thinked you've mastered it all*.

Every last thing in this repository is geared toward that all-important set of tasks which are all about really understanding YOUR OWN life's mission and then devise YOUR OWN strategy for optimizing your OWN time in order to accomplish YOUR OWN life's mission accordingly ... there's nothing here that is about giving the appearance of having your life organized according to someone else's plan. The entire reason for the existence of this repository is for YOU to think deeply about time management in YOUR life for YOUR purposes. It's YOUR time ... it's up to YOU to learn skills to better optimize YOUR time.  

The best way to optimize your time is actually to optimize the time management of others ... do not expect to be *loved* or respected for this, immediately.  Many people will be offended when they learn that they are wasting time, using second-class methods like commuting to work when others have switched to remote-work or work-from-anywhere so that they are better able to manage their time and devote more effort to their WHY rather than just habitually driving.

The second principle of 86400.GURU time management discipline is going to be similarly difficult for some to embrace. Open source development is truly revolutionary in terms of what it means for time management in a macro sense. Through your own efforts, your work at making open source development work much better by using it will have gigantic impacts on even the smallest elements of your life, such as your time management discipline and where your day goes.
