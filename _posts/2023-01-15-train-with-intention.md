# How Do We Improve The Discipline of Optimizing Our NOW

We don't just train ... but we try to train WITH INTENTION ... that means, in this day in age, that we augment our own human intelligence with the intelligence of crowds as we dogfood the development the artificial intelligence in the toolchains we use as we train in the knowledge engineering discipline.

Our TABATA workouts are not just workouts ... these four-minute primarily-physical drills are spaced in-between our 25 minute pomodoros of primarily-intellectual knowledge engineering work ... but the same mindset and discipline is something that we attempt to bring to the entire day of training ... every waking moment is about training ... when we sleep, we try to sleep ... but when we can't sleep, we get up an train ... when we fell too tired to train, we take a 25 minute nap.

Training with intenion is thus a thoroughly recursive mindset ... it's a knowledge flywheel which we try to spin up in the morning and then keep spinning all day long until we're exhausted ... it is always about training to be better able to train ... it is always intentional in that we work trying to improve the discipline of optimizing our NOW.
