Of course, you should use automation ... but improving the discipline is about the meta-programming skill of how you go about improving everything in the execution of the discipline, including anything you do to tinker with or refactor the automation you use to support the discipline.

# Not just practicing with intention, but DAILY improvement of discipline
 
Particular care should be taken to put time mgmt discipline not just into practice ... but to work diligently to OWN the discipline and to adjust, tailor, refactor and improve the discipline of the practice.

Without the repetition of OWNERSHIP ... and, actually *doing it* as if the discipline is a valued asset ... the so-called knowledge of the time management skillset becomes nothing more than self-deception.

We, of course, will recognize this kind of self-deception in people who read a Wikipedia entry and believe that they understand a topic ... it's maybe even worse in the use of AI to generate content for code, a blog posting, a professional article or a legal brief.

TIME MGMT has to be OWNED ... it's not just the skill itself, but it's more the case with the discipline of time management and the daily refinement of the discipline. 

It's not JUST that the only advantages come from actually doing something ... understanding something requires the repitition of improvement of the perfect repitition AND the correction of the imperfect repition.

It's necessary to FAIL ... to gain humility ... or otherwise, it is nothing but VANITY of no-depth ... which happens when someone thinks they get, but ... has engaged in self-deception.

When we do no IMPROVE our time management discipline ... we deceive only ourselves.
