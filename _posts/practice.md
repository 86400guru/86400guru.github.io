Particular care should be taken to put time mgmt discipline not just into practice, but to improve the discipline of the practice ... or otherwise, without repetition and *doing it*, the so-called knowledge becomes nothing more than self-deception.

We find this kind of self-deception in people who read a Wikipedia entry and believe that they understand a topic ... it's more the case with the discipline of time management.

It's not JUST that the only advantages come from actually doing something ... understanding something requires the repitition of improvement of the perfect repitition AND the correction of the imperfect repition.

It's necessary to FAIL ... to gain humility ... or otherwise, it is nothing but VANITY of no-depth ... which happens when someone thinks they get, but ... has engaged in self-deception.

When we do no IMPROVE our time management discipline ... we deceive only ourselves.
